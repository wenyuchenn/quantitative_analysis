3. Credit Default Swap Term Structure\
A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial derivative or contract that allows an investor to "swap" or offset his or her credit risk with that of another investor.\ The term structure of CDS spreads reflects the shape of the conditional risk-neutral default probability over different time horizons. Under structural models of credit risk, default is value based, and typically results from a decline in the value of operational cash flows.\
